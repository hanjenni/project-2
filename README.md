# Honest Schools 
As a former teacher, I realized there was lack of information available that kept districts accountable for providing teachers with honest information about the schools's community, administrators and work-life balance.

Honest Schools was created so that teachers would have a platform where they can freely discuss the working environment of different school districts so they can find a workplace that is suited to their needs.
